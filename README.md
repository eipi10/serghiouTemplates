# serghiouTemplates

<div align="justify">
 
An R Markdown template that combines all templates I use and all of my pre-defined code to avoid retyping a banch of code all the time. Excited to hear about any ideas/feedback about what could be done better! 

Please reference the repository if you happen to use it :)

## Install

```{r}
library(devtools); install_github(serghiou/serghiouTemplates)
```

## Use

```{r}
library(serghiouTemplates)
```

## Customize

If you fork this repo, you can change the original template however you please and create your own template with your own preferences. Ideally, this would be part of the package, but at the moment there is no bandwidth to work on this.
